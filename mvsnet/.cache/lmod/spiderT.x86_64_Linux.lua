  Illumina's bcl-convert is the (future) successor to bcl2fastq. The application
  converts Binary Base Call (BCL) files produced by Illumina sequencing systems
  to FASTQ files. bcl-convert also provides adapter handling (through masking
  and trimming) and UMI trimming and produces metric outputs.

  a GFF3 file representing annotations on one high quality assembly in 
  the HAL alignment, and produces a output GFF3 annotation on all target

  a GFF3 file representing annotations on one high quality assembly in 
  the HAL alignment, and produces a output GFF3 annotation on all target

  LDhelmet is a software program for statistical inference of fine-scale

  assumes the sample of DNA sequences is randomly drawn from a single
  population, and that the population followed a neutral evolution with constant
  population size. However, the statistical inference can still be accurate even
  with mild deviations from these assumptions. LDhelmet can handle sample sizes
  of up to 50 individuals (haplotypes), and is suitable for whole-genome
  sequence analysis.

  ## Description ## 
  
  Octopus is a mapping-based variant caller that implements several calling
  models within a unified haplotype-aware framework. Each calling model is
  designed for a particular kind of experimental design. Octopus takes
  inspiration from particle filtering by constructing a tree of haplotypes and
  dynamically pruning and extending the tree based on haplotype posterior
  probabilities in a sequential manner. This allows octopus to implicitly
  consider all possible haplotypes at a given loci in reasonable time.

FLTK (pronounced "fulltick") is a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit for
UNIX/Linux (X11), Microsoft Windows, and MacOS X. FLTK provides modern
GUI functionality without the bloat and supports 3D graphics via OpenGL
and its built-in GLUT emulation. FLTK is designed to be small and
modular enough to be statically linked, but works fine as a shared
library. FLTK also includes an excellent UI builder called FLUID that
can be used to create applications in minutes.

The Persistence of Vision Raytracer creates three-dimensional, photo-
realistic images using a rendering technique called ray-tracing. It
reads in a text file containing information describing the objects and
lighting in a scene and generates an image of that scene from the view
point of a camera also described in the text file. Ray-tracing is not a
fast process by any means, but it produces very high quality images with
realistic reflections, shading, perspective and other effects.

Conveniently import and query gene models. A set of tools and methods
for making and manipulating transcript centric annotations. With these
tools the user can easily download the genomic locations of the
transcripts, exons and cds of a given organism, from either the UCSC
Genome Browser or a BioMart database (more sources will be supported in
the future). This information is then stored in a local database that
keeps track of the relationship between transcripts, exons, cds and
genes. Flexible methods are provided for extracting the desired features

Plotting data and annotation information along genomic coordinates.
Genomic data analyses requires integrated visualization of known genomic
information and new experimental data. Gviz uses the biomaRt and the
rtracklayer packages to perform live annotation queries to Ensembl and
UCSC and translates this to e.g. gene/transcript structures in viewports
of the grid graphics package. This results in genomic information
plotted together with your data.

'Rcpp' Integration for 'GNU GSL' Vectors and Matrices. 'Rcpp'
integration for 'GNU GSL' vectors and matrices The 'GNU Scientific
Library' (or 'GSL') is a collection of numerical routines for scientific
computing. It is particularly useful for C and C++ programs as it
provides a standard C interface to a wide range of mathematical
routines. There are over 1000 functions in total with an extensive test
suite. The 'RcppGSL' package provides an easy-to-use interface between
'GSL' data structures and R using concepts from 'Rcpp' which is itself a
package that eases the interfaces between R and C++. This package also
serves as a prime example of how to build a package that uses 'Rcpp' to
connect to another third-party library. The 'autoconf' script, 'inline'
plugin and example package can all be used as a stanza to write a
similar package against another library.

R Interface to the 'PostgreSQL' Database System. Database interface and
PostgreSQL driver for R This package provides a Database Interface (DBI)
compliant driver for R to access PostgreSQL database systems. In order
to build and install this package from source, PostgreSQL itself must be
present your system to provide PostgreSQL functionality via its
libraries and header files. These files are provided as postgresql-devel
package under some Linux distributions. On Microsoft Windows system the
attached libpq library source will be used. A wiki and issue tracking
system for the package are available at Google Code at
https://code.google.com/p/rpostgresql/.

Surrogate Variable Analysis. The sva package contains functions for
removing batch effects and other unwanted variation in high-throughput
experiment. Specifically, the sva package contains functions for the
identifying and building surrogate variables for high-dimensional data
sets. Surrogate variables are covariates constructed directly from high-
dimensional data (like gene expression/RNA sequencing/methylation/brain
imaging data) that can be used in subsequent analyses to adjust for
unknown, unmodeled, or latent sources of noise. The sva package can be
used to remove artifacts in three ways: (1) identifying and estimating
surrogate variables for unknown sources of variation in high-throughput
experiments (Leek and Storey 2007 PLoS Genetics,2008 PNAS), (2) directly
removing known batch effects using ComBat (Johnson et al. 2007
Biostatistics) and (3) removing batch effects with known control probes
(Leek 2014 biorXiv). Removing batch effects and using surrogate
variables in differential expression analysis have been shown to reduce
dependence, stabilize error rate estimates, and improve reproducibility,
see (Leek and Storey 2007 PLoS Genetics, 2008 PNAS or Leek et al. 2011
Nat. Reviews Genetics).
